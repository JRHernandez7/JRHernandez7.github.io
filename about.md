Welcome to That's My Thumb!

This is the earliest possible stage of what I hope will one day be a fun game for us all to play: 
Thumbs? Hands? Arms? Eyes, ears, noses...can you pick yours out of a lineup of 5? 25? 50??? 
Hell, I don't know, but we will find out just how much of "you" you need to find yourself. 

Obviously, there is much work to be done between here and there. 

Consider yourselves my pre-alpha-testers.
